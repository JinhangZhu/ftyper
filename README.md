This is a program used for typing French and designed for those who are using English keyboard and are annoyed by French keyboard :). 

> While writing this MFC-based programme, I knew nothing about the French keyboard on Windows. If you prefer not to touch your mouse, you may try the French keyboard on Windows!
>
> Also, I had no idea about GitHub then and I was unintentional to save the codes... I may have lost them already.

## Usage

The first step is to run the FTyper1.exe. (downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/JinhangZhu/ftyper/releases/))

Then you can type your own text after deleting the words which try to remind you of this sentence again.

You can type after the last letter or before the first letter or insert text among the letters.

You can also adjust the font size to your taste by moving the scroll button.

ATTENTION, when you need to type the letter with accent, including the letters below:

À, Â, Ç, È, É, Ê, Ë, Î, Ï, Ô, Œ, Ù, Û, Ü, à, â, ç, è, é, ê, ë, î, ï, ô, œ, ù, û, ü,

you need to 
- press 	Ctrl + A 	for 	À, Â, à, à;
- press 	Ctrl + C 	for 	Ç, ç;
- press 	Ctrl + E	for 	È, É, Ê, Ë, è, é, ê, ë;
- press 	Ctrl + I  	for 	Î, Ï, î, ï;
- press 	Ctrl + O 	for 	Ô, Œ, ô, œ;
- press 	Ctrl + U 	for 	Ù, Û, Ü, ù, û, ü;
then click Add button.

ATTENTION Again, to type out the CAPITAL letters, you muct ensure the CapsLock on your keyboard is on.

However, I have not included some sons, (this is the french word which means phonetic transcriptions) like ɑ̃, ŋ, ɥ, etc.

You can copy the whole text by clicking the Copy button. Sadly, I have not designed the function by which you can double click the selected text area to copy. I will try to add this in the next edition.

I know the touch keyboard on Microsft Windows systems is a little bit hard to use because you have to click the button one by one. And I personally think this one is more convenient than the Microsoft touch keyboard. However, I have not tried to discover a existed French Typewriter on Internet, if there is one, I'll try to make mine better than that and I said try not will :(. This program is in its baby period, I hope you could forgive me if there are some bugs which are more annoying than a French Keyboard.
